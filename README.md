Dataset:
We are provided with the Excel datasheet which contains the employees data for 3 months between April 2022-June 2022. Dataset contains information on employee codes, employee names, and their attendance records along with attendance keys such as “SL” for Sick Leave and “WFH” for Work From Home.

Thoroughly clean the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability by addressing missing values, incorrect formatting, outliers, or duplicate entries.

Methodology:
- Data Integration: Import the Excel dataset into PowerBI.
- Data Transformation: Conduct ETL processes and clean the data using Power Query.
